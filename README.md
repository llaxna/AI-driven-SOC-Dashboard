# AI-Driven SOC Dashboard for Anomaly Detection

This project presents an **AI-powered Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard** designed to detect and visualize network anomalies using unsupervised machine learning models. Built with Python and Streamlit, the system provides cybersecurity analysts with an intuitive tool to analyze traffic logs, detect intrusions, and make informed decisions in real time.

## 🔍 Features

- 📁 **CICIDS 2017 Dataset**: Real-world network traffic data
- 🧠 **Unsupervised ML Models**: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One-Class SVM
- 📉 **Dimensionality Reduction** with PCA
- 📈 **Visual Performance Metrics**: F1-Score, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Accuracy
- ⚠️ **Detection of Attacks** like PortScan, DDoS, and Infiltration
- 📊 **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**
